# cisc275-estuarygame
Estuary Tower Defense Game for CISC275 2015F

To have access to the repository in Eclipse first you must install EGit
  - Open Eclipse and go to Help -> install new software
  - paste this link:  http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates
  - Select Collaboration and hit next to accept and install the software
  - Eclipse should now restart and if it worked properly under 
    Window -> Perspective -> Open Perspective -> Other... you should find Git
  - I had issues with the first install and needed to repeat the above process 
    with this link as well: http://download.eclipse.org/releases/mars
  - Now that everything installed you can either search in Eclipse for git to
    find a cheat sheet for cloning a Git repository or simply go to:
    File -> Import... then Git -> Repositories from GitHub where you can search
    for this repo: cisc275-estuarygame with Any Language selected and you should
    see the repo created publicly by me(xXGp). Finish up the remaining prompts
    and you should now see the repo under the git repositories perspective in 
    Eclipse. Once a Java project is created on the repo you should be able to 
    see the files in your normal Java enviroment

Once everyone has this we can continue with our classes and method stubs
